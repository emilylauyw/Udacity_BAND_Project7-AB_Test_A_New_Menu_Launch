# Udacity BAND Project 7 - AB Test A New Menu Launch

# Description
Round Roasters is a coffee restaurant in the United States of America. The executive team conducted a market test with a new menu and needs to figure whether the new menu can drive enough sales to offset the cost of marketing the new menu. This project is to analyze the A/B test and write up a recommendation to whether the Round Roasters chain should launch this new menu.
